    <h2>Shrimp and Pesto-Rice Salad</h2>
    <p>One of the great things about this Shrimp and Pesto-Rice Salad is that you can literally serve it any way you like it. Serve this brand-new twist on the old rice salad warm, or make it ahead, chill, and serve cold. This simple dish has delicately seasoned shrimp baked in the oven, then combined with a spinach pesto to create a delicious, quick, and healthy dinner. You’ll love the zing of the lime and the lime zest, the fresh taste of the mint, and the spice of garlic, while the almonds will add a deep, smoky flavor. Combined together, these ingredients make a full, rich, flavorful meal perfect for summer but delightful at any time.</p>
