    <h2>Chicken-and-Rice</h2>
    <p>Few dishes conjure up ideas of dinnertime classics more than chicken and rice, and this recipe helps you have this family favorite on the table quickly. For this crowd-pleasing dish, cut the cooking time in half by using skinned-and-boned chicken breasts, and ready-to-serve long-grain rice. Frozen peas and canned mushrooms will also help you keep the preparation time to a minimum, but this dish will still taste absolutely delicious. Crispy bacon adds just that little touch of smoky, crunchy flavor, and, topped with fresh parsley, this dinner even presents beautifully. If you like, you can substitute the green peas for snow peas for a different texture. However you prefer it, this quick-fix supper is wonderful.</p>
