    <h2>Slow-Cooker Red Beans and Rice</h2>
    <p>Few dishes embody the true tastes of the South more than red beans and rice, and this slow-cooker recipe helps you get their flavors on the table without spending all day in the kitchen. For this recipe weâ€™ve used thinly sliced smoked turkey sausage, which works wonderfully in a slow cooker, as well as sweet onion, two types of bell pepper, and a hint of Creole seasoning. To give this quick-fix dinner a little extra spice, you can add hot sauce if you like. Top this Slow-Cooker Red Beans and Rice with finely chopped red onions, or finely chopped green onion. Both will add a little extra spice to this amazing dish</p>
