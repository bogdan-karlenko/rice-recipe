    <h2>Texas Caviar Rice and Beans</h2>
    <p>When a Southerner says “Texas Caviar” it usually means “black-eyed peas” although for some people it just means “beans.” To avoid any confusion, this recipe combines black-eyed peas and black beans, creating a delicious medley of both. To keep it quick and simple, they are microwaved with roasted red bell peppers and poblano peppers, and—after marinating for 20 minutes—are hot and ready to go in only two minutes more. So get ready to turn a Lone Star State appetizer into a simple weeknight main dish. Customize with any topping, such as guacamole, salsa, or a dollop of sour cream. This will be caviar you are sure to love, Texas-style.</p>
