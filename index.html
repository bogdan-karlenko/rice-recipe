        <p>Got a box of instant rice in the pantry? You've got supper! Try one of these fast and easy recipes that use quick-cooking rice for tonight's meal.</p>
        <p>If you think rice recipes are oh-so-ho-hum, think again. Even if you didn’t grow up in places like South Carolina or Louisiana, where this grain reigns, you’ll love the delicious pops of Southern flavor we’ve added to easy rice recipes that anybody can make. Get a taste of the Lone Star State with Texas Caviar Rice and Beans—and ramp up the Tex-Mex even more by topping with guacamole, salsa, and sour cream. Lime juice and jalapeno bring summery zest with a kick to our Southwest Chicken Rice Bowl. For a Louisiana-tinged rice recipe, try Slow-Cooker Red Beans and Rice or Skillet Sausage ’n’ Rice—or “go Gulf” with Shrimp-and-Pesto-Rice Salad. Brush up on the basics with Fried Rice 101, an easy rice recipe enlivened with chili garlic sauce, bell pepper, and sweet green peas. Want something healthy and pretty? Try our Chicken-and-Wild-Rice Salad. They’re all quick dinner ideas—and delicious.</p>
